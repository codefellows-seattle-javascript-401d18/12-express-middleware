// ## Tests _make an attempt at TDD today!!_
//   _note: Your tests should still function correctly as you iterate and refactor your code. Do not start writing a refactor until you have functional tests._

// * write a test to ensure that your api returns a status code of 404 for routes that have not been registered

// * write tests to ensure the `/api/simple-resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
//* `GET`: test 404, it should respond with 'not found' for valid requests made with an id that was not found
//* `GET`: test 400, it should respond with 'bad request' if no id was provided in the request

//* `GET`: test 200, it should contain a response body for a request made with a valid id


//* `POST`: test 400, it should respond with 'bad request' if no request body was provided or the body was invalid
//* `POST`: test 201, it should respond with the body content for a post request with a valid body
//* `PUT`: test 400, it should respond with 'bad request' if no request body was provided or the body was invalid

//* `PUT`: test 204, it should respond with no body content for a put request with a valid body


//* `DELETE`: test 400, it should respond with 'bad request' if no resource id was provided
//* `DELETE`: test 404, it should respond with 'not found' for valid requests made with an id that was not found
//* `DELETE`: test 204, it should respond with no body content for a request request with a valid resource id
