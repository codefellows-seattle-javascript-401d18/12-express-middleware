## Project Description
Using node.js, HTTP, superagent, and Express I have created a Server that responds to different GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE responses from users. This project represents what is possible with a few simple tools. We can create persistence memory through the filesystem feature of node.js which can then be used to simulate a database api for a user or dev.

### Installation:
+ Fork this repository and clone the forked repository anywhere you'd like on your computer.

+ Open your terminal
  + Navigate to the folder where you did your git clone with your newly forked repository.
  + Make sure you are in the root directory IE. lab-gavin.;
  + Type npm i into your terminal.
+ Open two terminal windows.
+ In the first terminal type
  + `npm run start:watch`

  + This creates a local server which should log to the console
    + `server up:: 3000`

+ In the second terminal window
  + `brew install httpie`

  + This installs httpie which is a package that allows you to make calls to our local server.


+ Here are a list of commands you may use to make API calls to this vanilla server.
